# Pi Plotter

### Features

- Converts images to g-code
- Translates g-code to stepper movement
- Works with arduio and can run on rasberry pi
- Working Plotter code for Prototype Plotter

## Requirements to use 
- Raspberry Pi 3/4/400
- Arduino Mega or better
- 3 28BYJ-48 Steppers and control boards
- 3D printed Supports
- Lego technic peices

## How to use 
- Install python and the required programs onto your pi
- Using the instructions, or a prebuilt structure, design a housing for the plotter
- Connect the 28BYJ-48 Stepper motors to their control board and follow the circut diagrams.

- Connect the Pi to the Arduino
- Run the plotterguy.py program
- Upload a photo of your choice
- Hit run and presto it will draw the image onto a peice of paper!
